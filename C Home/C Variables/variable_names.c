// The general rules for naming variables are:

// Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
// Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
// Names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
// Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
// Reserved words (such as int) cannot be used as names
